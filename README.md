Giveaway Demo — Harmless & Educational

This is a local-only Giveaway Demo app designed strictly for educational use. Intended to demonstrate basic web app mechanics—no phishing, no real user data, and always operating within legal and ethical boundaries.

Features:

A simple frontend for entering a giveaway (Name & Email).

An Admin panel to update display text and view/clear entries.

A local camera/microphone demo—shows how getUserMedia works, without sending your data anywhere.

How to Run
git clone https://github.com/ARS-termux-zone2017/giveaway-demo.git
cd giveaway-demo
chmod +x run.sh
./run.sh


Then open your browser at http://localhost:3000.

Visit /admin/login (Password: admin123) to access admin panel.

Visit /demo/media to see the camera/mic demo (permissions required).
